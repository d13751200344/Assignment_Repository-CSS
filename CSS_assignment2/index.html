      <p class="note">Verse 1</p>
      <br />
      <p class="soliloquize">
        Why do I deserve the silence? <br />
        To feel better about you? <br />
        At a loss, I lost my cool <br />
        I denied that I found you <br />
        I tried to be a basket case <br />
        I did not surprise you <br />
        I'm trying to find a signal fire <br />
        Let me know when I should move <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="note">Chorus</p>
      <br />
      <p class="blaming">
        But you, amplified in the silence <br />
        Justified in the way you make me bruise <br />
        Magnified in the silence <br />
        Anatomically proved that you don't need me <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="note">Verse 2</p>
      <br />
      <p class="soliloquize">
        Why do I desire the space? <br />
        I was mourning after you <br />
        I was lost and lost my shape <br />
        There was nothing I could do <br />
        I don't want to waste away <br />
        It was all I gave to you <br />
        Take me back and take my place <br />
        I will rise right up for you <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="note">Chorus</p>
      <br />
      <p class="blaming">
        But you, amplified in the silence <br />
        Justified in the way you make me bruise <br />
        Magnified in the silence <br />
        Anatomically proved that you don't need me <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="note">Bridge</p>
      <br />
      <p class="intense">
        All the while you waste away, you're asking <br />
        "Did I really need another one to take me down?" <br />
        Everybody knows it's something that you had to live with, darling <br />
        Nobody's gonna tear you down now <br />
      </p>
      <p class="intense2">
        There is nothing you keep, there is only your reflection <br />
        (There is nothing you keep, there is only your reflection) <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <p class="note">Outro</p>
      <br />
      <p class="fierce">
        There was nothing but quiet retractions <br />
        And families pleading, "Don't look in that cabinet <br />
        There's far more bad than there's good, I don't know how it got there"
        <br />
        That was something your father had burned in me <br />
        Twenty hours out of Homestake eternity <br />
        "You can go anywhere but you are where you came from" <br />
        Little girl, you are cursed by my ancestry <br />
        There is nothing but darkness and agony <br />
        I can not only see, but you stopped me from blinking <br />
        Let me watch you as close as a memory <br />
        Let me hold you above all the misery <br />
        Let me open my eyes and be glad that I got here <br /><br />
